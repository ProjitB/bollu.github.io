# Musing on the structure of scientific revolutions

> One of the things that really struck me reading The Structure of Scientific
> Revolutions was the observation in it that you could almost always
> distinguish scientific fields from other by whether they taught students
> using the original works of those who made important discoveries or if they
> re-wrote them into easier to understand textbooks. If you can't separate the
> truth of what someone said from the way they said it you might be doing
> something useful but you don't have the tools to be making actual progress.
